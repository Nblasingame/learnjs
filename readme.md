# Learn.js
> A series of guidebooks to building javascript projects.

The original Learn.js book started to get big and mushy and confusing, and I realized that what I really needed to do was create a series of smaller books, so that's what I'm working on now.

The original book is now split up into 4 books:

- [Development Environments for Beginners](http://learnjs.io/books/dev-envs/)
- [Learn.js #1: introduction to javascript](http://learnjs.io/books/learnjs-01/)
- [Learn.js #2: making 2d games with node.js and browserify](http://learnjs.io/books/learnjs-02/)
- [Learn.js #3: mapping with leaflet.js](http://learnjs.io/books/learnjs-03/)

Books #2 and #3 will be released in November. You can [buy the 4-book bundle early](http://learnjs.io/) at a discount and get updates to all books for free.

Interested in seeing Learn.js #4 be a specific topic? Let me know at seth@superbigtree.com.

You can purchase the books at [learnjs.io](http://learnjs.io).


You can find the original Learn.js book in old-book.md.
